# Hybrid Semantic City Recommendation System

This project implements a **sentiment-aware semantic recommendation system** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
It recommends cities and places based on a user’s text query by combining semantic similarity, category prediction,
and sentiment analysis.

---

## Project Overview

The system analyzes textual reviews to understand:
- What users are talking about (semantic meaning)
- How users feel (sentiment)

It uses a hybrid pipeline combining unsupervised clustering, supervised classification,
and similarity-based ranking.

---

## Key Features

- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF–based text vectorization
- Pseudo-category discovery using KMeans
- Category prediction using Logistic Regression
- Rating-based weakly supervised sentiment analysis
- Hybrid recommendation scoring using similarity, sentiment, and metadata
